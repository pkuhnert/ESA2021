This is a respository for the talk given at the recent ESA 2021 conference 
entitled `Vizumap: an R package for visualising uncertainty in spatial data`.
I spoke on Thursday the 25th of November 2021 in the session on Remote Sensing 
in Ecology.

[ESA 2021](https://esa2021.org.au/) is the 61st Annual Conference of the Ecological Society of Australia

In this repository you will find the following:

- A copy of the slides presented at the conference.
- Datasets used in the presentation:
  * remote sensing data that was used to visualise the variability of fractional        cover in the Bowen catchment.
  * Bowen catchment SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
- An R script to reproduce the figures in the presentation.

For instructions on how to install `Vizumap`, see Lydia Luchessi's [github](https://github.com/lydialucchesi/Vizumap) repository.
